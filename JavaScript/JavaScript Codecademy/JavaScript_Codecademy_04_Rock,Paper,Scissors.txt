Hello all, this is an example of prompts, if else statements, and two variables. This can best be compared to a more 
complex version of the 2nd text doc which is the Create Your Own Adventure doc(though they were presistant on making you
make their story). This is a great example of a game that takes in the user input, creates the computers imput, and then 
decides who wins. This may seem overly complex but with practice this is incredibly simple, infact all three else if
else if statements are the same excluding variables. 




var userChoice = prompt("Do you choose rock, paper or scissors?");
var computerChoice = Math.random();
if (computerChoice < 0.34) {
	computerChoice = "rock";
} else if(computerChoice <= 0.67) {
	computerChoice = "paper";
} else {
	computerChoice = "scissors";
}

var compare = function(choice1, choice2) {
 if (choice1 === choice2) {
return "The result is a tie!";
    }
if(choice1 === choice2) {
    return "The result is a tie";
}

else if(choice1 === "rock") {

    if(choice2 === "scissors") {
        return "rock wins";
    }
    else {
        return "paper wins";
    }
}
else if(choice1 === "paper") {
   
    if(choice2 === "rock") {
        return "paper wins";
    }
    else {
        return "scissors wins";
    }    
}
else {
 if(choice2 === "rock") {
     return "rock wins";
 }
else {
    return "scissors wins";
}
}
};
console.log(compare(userChoice, computerChoice));



This pretty much concludes this program and feel free to run it to test it out. Hang in there.
