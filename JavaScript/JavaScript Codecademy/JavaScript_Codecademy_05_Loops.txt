To begin lets start with one of the first loops you will learn, the for loop. Say you wanted to print out something,
maybe 5 or even ten times. This gets really tedious after a while so besides spamming ctrl v over and over just
write a for loop like this.

for (var counter = 1; counter < 11; counter++) {
	console.log(counter);
}

This will have the program inside the loop repeat 10 times (11-1), so in this case it will print out counter 10 timmes.
This will be incredibly useful for any function that requires repetative actions ten or more times. Just remember never
have an infinite loop or it will crash your console/browser. This would happen in a function like
(var i = 10; counter > 1; counter++)  - dont run this
