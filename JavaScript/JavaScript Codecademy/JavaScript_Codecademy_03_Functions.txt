Now this is where we can put together lines of code learned in the previous documents into strands
for the more complex coding.


var divideByThree = function (number) {
    var val = number / 3;
    console.log(val);
};
divideByThree(6);

This is called a function and it has a large amount of uses in JavaScript in order to save time typing code. This 
function creates a variable called divideByThree, makes it no the value of the variable is equal to 1/3 the input,
and then has the console return the solution. Therefore any number that is put into this will be 1/3 of the
origional. Another example of a function that instead take your name and print it out in a sentence is the following.

var greeting = function (name) {
console.log("Great to see you," + " " + name);
};
greeting("Emily");

Here are some more examples:

var orangeCost = function (price)
{ console.log(price * 5)
    }
orangeCost(5)

var timesTwo = function(number) {
return number * 2;
};
var newNumber = timesTwo(2)
console.log(newNumber);

var perimeterBox = function(length , width){
return length + length + width + width
}
perimeterBox(2, 2)

var my_number = 7;
var timesTwo = function(number) {
my_number = number * 2;
console.log("Inside the function my_number is: ");
console.log(my_number);
}; 
timesTwo(7);
console.log("Outside the function my_number is: ")
console.log(my_number);


This pretty much covers function, hope it helped. Hang in there.
