Welcome, this is an example of what you can put your now skills to. Now I had to type this for an online lesson
and I admit this is horrible... but none the less it still can help you decide how you can test your ability to 
put together this program. Want to make a better program than this? Go ahead, I need one.











// Check if the user is ready to play!
confirm("ready?");
var age = prompt("Whats your age?");
if (age < 13) {
console.log("You're not my problem");
}
else (age > 13)
console.log(introduction)
console.log("Suddenly, Bieber stops and says, 'Who wants to race me?'")
var userAnswer = prompt("Do you want to race Bieber on stage?");
if (userAnswer === 'yes')
    console.log("You and Bieber start racing. It's neck and neck! You win by a shoelace!");
else if (useranswer === 'no')
console.log("Oh no! Bieber shakes his head and sings 'I set a pace, so I can race without pacing.'");
var feedback = prompt("Rate from 1 to 10.");
if (feedback >= 8)
console.log("Thank you! We should race at the next concert")
else (feedback < 8)
console.log("I'll keep practicing coding and racing");
var introduction = ("You are at a Justin Bieber concert, and you hear 
this lyric 'Lace my shoes off, start racing.'")






Dont understand parts of the code? Look at the previous document and try to find what your didnt understand here. Hang in there.
