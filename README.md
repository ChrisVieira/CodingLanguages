# CodingLanguages

What this document will feature:
    Notes on several of the following languages
      -Javascript
      -HTML/CSS
      -Java
      -Python
      -more to come
Reasons behind this document:
    Me and a few coders I know always have trouble when it comes to setting aside enough time to learn a coding language or
  simply remembering it from a year or so ago. Due to this we decided we instead will document everything we learn in these online
  lessons to both benefit us and anyone who reads this. This is meant not to be a full lesson on these languages but instead as a 
  refresher for those who need it. Hang in there.
